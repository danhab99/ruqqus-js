The **Reference** section contains information about all the classes, type definitions, and their properties and/or methods.<br>

!!! note "Note"
    Most of the classes are only used internally and are not exported[^1].
    Typedef objects - or **interfaces** - are for ease-of-access, and really only represent data objects.

[^1]: This may change in the future; however, only non-internal utility classes will be exempt (i.e. `Guild`, `User`, etc.)
